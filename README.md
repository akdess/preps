# PREPS
**PREPS** (**Pr**edicting **E**lectrophysiological **P**roperties of **S**ingle-cell RNA-seq) is a machine-learning-model-based ***computational framework*** that employs the state-of-the-art **GPT** (**G**enerative **P**re-trained **T**ransformer) models to predict electrophysiological features of single-cell RNA-seq of glioma samples. In the first step, leveraging the foundational GPT model, Geneformer, which has captured the complexity within human gene networks based on a broad range of healthy tissues, we **fine-tuned** the model into a series of brain-specific cell type classifiers using various developing brain and glioma datasets. Besides clustering and annotating glioma cells, we extracted and concatenated **embeddings** from the intermediate layers of these classifiers to represent comprehensive transcriptomic features of each cell.
