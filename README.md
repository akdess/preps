# PREPS
**PREPS** (**Pr**edicting **E**lectrophysiological **P**roperties of **S**ingle-cell RNA-seq) is a machine-learning-model-based **computational framework** that employs the state-of-the-art **GPT** (**G**enerative **P**re-trained **T**ransformer) models to predict electrophysiological features of single-cell RNA-seq of glioma samples. Leveraging the foundational GPT model, Geneformer, which has captured the complexity within human gene networks based on a broad range of healthy tissues, we fine-tuned the model into a series of brain-specific cell-type classifiers using various developing brain datasets.
