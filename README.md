# PREPS
**PREPS** (**Pr**edicting **E**lectrophysiological **P**roperties of **S**ingle-cell RNA-seq) is a machine-learning-based ***computational framework*** that employs the state-of-the-art **GPT** (**G**enerative **P**re-trained **T**ransformer) models to predict electrophysiological features of glioma samples by single-cell RNA-sequencing. 
  
In the first step, leveraging the foundational GPT model, Geneformer, which has captured the complexity within human gene networks based on a broad range of healthy tissues, we **fine-tuned** the model into a series of brain-specific cell type classifiers using transcriptomes of various developing brain and glioma datasets. Besides clustering and annotating glioma cells, we extracted and concatenated **embeddings** from the intermediate layers of these classifiers to represent comprehensive transcriptomic features of each cell. Next, we built a group of predictive Elastic Nets (i.e., PREPS models) that **map** electrophysiological features of glioma cells to their embeddings, with models optimized through a systematic grid search of all parameter combinations. Finally, we applied PREPS models to **predict** electrophysiological features of a larger amount of glioma data, where conducting many Patch-seq experiments is time-consuming and labor-intensive.
